Hi there! 👋
<img src="/mnt/data/Gemini_Generated_Image_hnh4h2hnh4h2hnh4.jpg" width="180" align="left" />

I’m Aryan, a Computer Science student who enjoys turning ideas into reality through code.
I experiment, learn, break things (sometimes), and build them back better.
I’m currently focused on DSA, OS concepts, PL/SQL, and real-world dev skills.
